# pipa language

This is a programming language.
The goal is to bootstrap itself, is in to write the compiler
in the language itself. Also, it should
be more pleasant to write the compiler in the
new language.

## Features

Just enough to write a compiler.

* integers
* strings
* string formatters
* if statements
* loops
* structs
* tagged unions??
* pointers?
* functions
* python-style indent-based blocks
* minimal commas?
* compiles to assembly
* no auto memory management (you use malloc)
* syntax style is pleasant and is like Python (to me)
* do we need modules?
* iterators?
